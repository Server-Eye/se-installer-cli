# servereye Installer Script
Installs servereye from the command line.
This is a Powershell script. Powershell in version 3 or higher is recommended.

Instructions on how to install the current Powershell can be found here: https://technet.microsoft.com/library/Hh847837.aspx


## Introduction
This script will help to install servereye on systems without a full UI or when a full interactive setup is not needed.
This script can download the current version of the client, install the client, setup an OCC-Connector and setup a Sensorhub.

This script can also be used to apply a predefined template to the freshly installed Sensorhub.

## Download
It is recommended to use the official download for production use. The official version is also signed with a valid code-signing certificate.

```PowerShell
Invoke-WebRequest "https://occ.server-eye.de/download/se/Deploy-ServerEye.ps1" -OutFile Deploy-ServerEye.ps1
```

## Usage

The script can be controlled by using command line parameters.

The parameter _customerId_ and _secretKey_ must match the existing customer data. This is not your servereye username or password! Please contact our support team if you do not know the correct customerId and secretKey.

##### customerId
This is the internal customer number created when you install a new customer. This script cannot create a new customer.

##### secretKey
The _secretKey_ authenticates the servereye OCC-Connector Cloud connection. It is **NOT** your password.
